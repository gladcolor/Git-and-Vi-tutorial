## What is GitFlow?
GitFlow is a software developmental pattern to control versions of master, develop, release, feature branches, and so on. Based on Git and the idea of GitFLow, a software development team will have a clear workflow to control various versions in the life circle of software.

Before digging into the details, the following chart is helpful to give you a big picture of GitFlow. GitFlow uses these braches:

master: 

Hotfixes: emergecy bug fix.
Develop:

Release branches: When it is time to make a release, a release branch is created off of develop. The code in the release branch is deployed onto a suitable test environment, tested, and any problems are fixed directly in the release branch. 





Feature branches(Major feature for next release): Feature branches are branched off of the develop branch, and finished features and fixes are merged back into the develop branch when theyâ€™re ready for release. New development (new features, non-emergency bug fixes) are built in feature branches:

Feature branches(Feature for furture release):
