# What is _Design Patterns from Gang of Four_?

This is a book of four author: "_Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_
". In this book twenty-three design patterns are described with links to UML diagrams, source code and real-world
 examples for each.

You can find more information in [here](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/), and we borrow
 and list some keypoints below.

## Creational Design Patterns
1. Abstract Factory. Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.
2. Builder. Uses to create complex objects.
3. Factory Method. Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
4. Prototype. Creates a new object from an existing object.
5. Singleton. Ensures only one instance of an object is created.
 ##  Structural Design Patterns

6.  Adapter. Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing
 classes.
7. Bridge. Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
8. Composite. Takes a group of objects into a single object.
9. Decorator. Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
10. Facade. Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
11. Flyweight. Reduces the cost of complex object models.
12. Proxy. Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce
 complexity.
## Behavior Design Patterns
13. Chain of Responsibility. Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
14. Command. Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
15. Interpreter. Implements a specialized language.
16. Iterator. Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
17. Mediator. Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their
 methods.
18. Memento. Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
19. Observer. Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
20. State. Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
21. Strategy. Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
22. Template Method. Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide
 concrete behavior.
23. Visitor. Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.

# Why Gang of Four?
Gangs of Four design patterns presents the foundation of core design patterns in programming. The new programmers can
 learn from these experience to obtain better designs before coding.
 
 # How to use these patterns?
 Think object-oriently. Consider how to avoid rewrite the entire system when conduct a minor change. Do not repeat
  the code. If you feel pain and have no idea how design you first professional program, read that book.
