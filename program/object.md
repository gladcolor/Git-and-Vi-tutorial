# What is Object?
In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.

# Why Obejct?
An object, a instance of Class, means that the blueprint of a Class has been implemented and the spot of memory has
 been assigned to this object. Object is the implementation of Class can this separation of designed and implement
  privodes flexibility for coding. All the object derived from the same class will be updated if the class was
   changed. Also, the object is generated when necessary from its class, avoiding unnecessary usage of resources.

# How to use Object?
In Python, define a new object would like:
```
objectName = className()
```
