Let's try to enter the 'vi' at command at first.  
[]
Essentially, 'vi' serves as a multi-functional text editor in Linux platform.  
Using 'vi' command allows you to create a plain text file data in memory and do a editing. Let's create a file named 'test.txt':  
[]
In this interface, it tells us we successfully used to 'vi' created and opened file 'test.txt'. BUT we cannot perform typing yet, what should we do next?  
The next thing we do is to press the key 'i' on keyboard, it tells 'vi' : now is typeing mode.  
You will see a text label 'insert' at the left corner of screen when the key 'i' is pressed:
[]
Try to type anything.  
[]
Then, you can decide whether to save it or just ignore the changes. Before doing this, we need to press key 'Esc' to quit typing mode:  
[]
You will see the 'insert' label disappeared.  
Then, we press combinational key 'shift'+':' :  
[]
You can see a colon appeared at left corner. And now let's try to save it and quit the vi. We need to type key 'w' and 'q', the press 'Enter'. Now, you should go back to the first place where we launched 'vi'.  
Then we can try to use command 'ls -l' to see the file existed in current filepath:
[]
Yes! We have the file 'test.txt'.
