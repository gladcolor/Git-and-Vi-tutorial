# using up and down arrow for history
Pressing `↑` and `↓` keys on you keyboard is a way to show only one historical command on terminal.  
Say we just opened a terminal.

The `↑` simply means that show me the last command.

If you press it again, it just show the second last command.

The `↓` means show me the next command of current command. The working principle is similar to `↑`.

So, it back to the command at second picture.
