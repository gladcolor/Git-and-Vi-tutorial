# Before cd  
`cd` is a command to do the changing directory in Linux command line interface. 
Before we talk about `cd`, make sure you know the concept about `pwd`, `ls` and **home directory(~)**.  
# cd  
In Windows, you can just click mouse over a folder on screen. The command `cd` performs the same function as this mouse click in Windows.  
Say We want to go to another directory in Linux. Specifically, a directory under current directory. We can use `ls` to list every file and directory at current place:  
![](/image/cd/cd_1.jpg)  
And we want to go to directory **web**. Type the `cd` at first and we follow with the directory we want to go. In this case, it is **web** directorty:  
![](/image/cd/cd_2.jpg)  
Press enter, now you can see the blue character which shows the current your place append a **web** to the **~**. It means you successfully change the place to **web**.  
# Extra  
If you just type `cd` without anything, it directs you back to the default place **~**.  
If you just type `cd` with **..**, it leads you back to directory beofre the current place.
